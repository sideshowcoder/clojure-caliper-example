# clojure-caliper-example

Using [Caliper (0.5-rc1](https://github.com/google/caliper/tree/v0.5-rc1) from
clojure for microbenchmarking.

The important files to look at are `core.clj` defining a benchmark by extending
`SimpleBenchmark` and `runner.clj` using the calipers `Runner` class to run the
benchmark defined.

`project.clj` furthermore defines the usage of AOT, to make gen-class work as
expected.

## Usage

```
lein run
```
